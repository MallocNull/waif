 *    BINARY DECIMAL IS SHIFTED SUCH THAT THE NUMBER CAN BE WRITTEN USING PROPER   *
 *      SCIENTIFIC NOTATION, EG. 1.1011 x 2^n WHERE n IS THE EXPONENTIAL SHIFT     *
 *     NEEDED TO EXPRESS THE ORIGINAL BINARY DECIMAL. THE EXPONENT IS 'BIASED'     *
 *   WITH A BASE VALUE, MEANING THAT THE BIAS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF 2^0. THE BIAS   *
 *  FOR 64-BIT FLOATS IN THIS STANDARD IS 1023, WHICH MEANS THAT THE ACTUAL VALUE  *
 *  OF n IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE WOULD BE 1023 SUBTRACTED FROM THIS SEGMENT'S VALUE.  *

 *  IF THE NUMBER BEING PARSED IS 1.1011 x 2^n, THIS WILL ONLY BE 0.1011. THE ONE  *
 *  TO THE LEFT OF THE DECIMAL POINT IS ALWAYS IMPLIED, AND IS NOT STORED IN THIS  *
 *   SEGMENT SO AS TO GIVE AN EXTRA BIT OF PRECISION WHILE CUTTING A REDUNDANCY.   *
